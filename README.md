# Fashion MNIST Classification

This project aims to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset using both a neural network and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The Fashion MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, which are divided into 60,000 training and 10,000 testing samples.

In this project, I first use a neural network to classify the images into one of the ten categories, including t-shirts/tops, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots. Then I use a CNN to improve the performance of the classification task by adding convolutional layers and pooling layers.

The project is implemented using Python and TensorFlow. The code is available in this repository. This project can serve as a starting point for anyone interested in learning about image classification using neural networks and CNNs.
